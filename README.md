(Ab)using git to serve firmware binaries.

The firmware in the old [raspemie](https://github.com/hhpberlin/raspemie) firmware pulls from this repo.

The newer [rustpemie](https://github.com/hhpberlin/rustpemie) firmware doesn't connect to the internet. The software however does pull artifacts from online, but from GitHub Actions outputs in the main repo.
